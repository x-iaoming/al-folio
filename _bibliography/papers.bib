  title={Quantifying uncertainty in Shapley-value-based explanations for machine learning models (In Progress)},
  author={Ruiming Li},
  abstract={In this thesis, I study an approach inspired by game theory to explain how the features in the input data affect the output of machine learning models without access to the modelsâ€™ internal working. This approach assigns a number called Shapley value to each feature to indicate its importance and contribution to the model output, but has a few limitations and uncertainties. I study and compare two ways to quantify the uncertainties, using a mathematical concept called Shapley residuals and a statistical method called Bayesian SHAP, and aim to apply them in real-world data to investigate their differences. My goal is to make machine learning models more interpretable to humans so we can gain meaningful knowledge from them.},
