Hi! I'm a software engineer & data scientist experienced in back-end development, automation pipelines, and applied machine learning research. I design accessible and impact-driven software products and deliver explainable, fair, and actionable insights through data analysis. During my free time, I enjoy biking and playing badminton, traveling and taking photos, and just trying new things with friends!
