Hi! It's Ray! Iâ€™m from Foshan, China and went to school in Singapore. I am currently studying Computer Science at Haverford College.

I have been doing research on applied machine learning and interpretability in the [Dark Reactions Lab](https://github.com/darkreactions/DRP) and interned at [Tripli](http://tripli.com/) to design backend data pipeline and API for finding travel deals.

At Haverford College, I'm the Captain of [Club Badminton](https://haverford.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/haverfordbadminton) team and ex Board Member of the [International House](https://haverford.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/idomo). In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, tennis and biking. I love scenery and event [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/182113123@N06/) and have worked as a college photographer. I also like learning new languages so you can speak to me in Mandarin, Cantonese, English, French, and Italian!
