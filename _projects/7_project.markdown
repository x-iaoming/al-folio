<b>Chemical Reactions Recommendation Engine</b>

As current machine learning models only predict product formation for given reactions, I designed a recommendation engine to inform Chemists the next most informative and likely successful reactions to perform. Currently used by over 7 labs across the country.

<b>Generalized Reactions Prediction Using Meta-learning</b>

To generalize model's predictions on different categories of reactants, I explored few-shot meta-learning models such as MAML and PLATIPUS.

<b>Interpretable, Trust-worthy, and Informative Machine Learning for Scientists</b>

While there exists explanation methods for complex, black-box models, experimental Chemists don’t understand the models and explanations enough to trust their results. I conducted thesis research to investigate the reliability and trust-worthiness of machine learning explanation using Shapley value, and identified 3 sources of uncertainties (<a href="https://ruimingli.com/assets/pdf/thesis.pdf">Link</a>).
